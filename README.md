## Why?

I started develop this project to get experience launching apps in the app store and understand how it all works, but at the same time, I wanted to track some assets and see their news, and past prices. I decided to develop mine, instead download one!

## Clean Architecture

I used the Clean Architecture in this app 'cause that's my first time using Clean Architecture, and I implemented this, to improve and understand how Clean Architecture works in a real project.

## State Management

I Used Bloc in this project 'cause still is the only state management that I clearly understand, and I like that so much!

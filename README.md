# Rusky - Track your favorite assets

Rusky is an Android Application to track Brazillian and some Cryptocurrencies assets, in this app you can see nome news about assets and what's happening with them. You can see the prices historic in the last year from that assset too!

## Why?

I started develop this project to get experience launching apps in the app store and understand how it all works, but at the same time, I wanted to track some assets and see their news, and past prices. I decided to develop mine, instead download one!

## Clean Architecture

I used the Clean Architecture in this app 'cause that's my first time using Clean Architecture, and I implemented this, to improve and understand how Clean Architecture works in a real project.

##State Management

I Used Bloc in this project 'cause still is the only state management that I clearly understand, and I like that so much!
